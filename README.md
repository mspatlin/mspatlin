## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Patrick or you can call me Pat.<br>
<br>
Iâ€™m not here to give a formal introduction about myself. This is just a little space for jotting down notes about random ideas, research, side projects, and other stuff that pops up in my daily life or career.
<br>
The content here, whether created by me or referenced from others, isnâ€™t rigorous. Itâ€™s just for notes and self-reflection.
